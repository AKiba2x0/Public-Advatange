Rise of the TMNT Episode Guide,,,,
"There are some pretty Yikes decisions in the airing order, inclusive of long April droughts. Production code probably won't be released until S1 is over, so here's a relatively spoiler-free guide on my interpretation of ep continuity. Some of these can of course, be swapped around. If anyone wants I can give additional explanation, but really most of it's because they reference events of past episodes.",,,,
